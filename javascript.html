            <h3>Overview of Javascript</h3>
            <p style = "margin-left: 30px; float: left;">Javascript lets us host and intereact with dynamic content on the web. It can create interactive applications that log user input, change what's displayed, and animate objects. Along with HTML and CSS, Javascript is one of three modern web programming languages. There are many components of Javascript.</p>

            <h3>Components of Javascript</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables - A variable is like a bucket. A variable is a named location for a value that gets stored in the browser's memory when a program is run. There are three main data types that you can store into a variable. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Strings - Written text</li>
                        <li>Integers - Numeric data
                        </li>
                        <li>Booleans - True/False statements
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Functions - A function is a predefined action that can be called later in your code. To define a function, the keyword "function" is used. Following this keyword is the name of your function, a set of paranthesis, and a set of curly braces. Inside these curly braces is where you put the code for your function. </li>
                <li>Alerts, prompts, and confirms - Alerts, confirms, and prompts create popup windows in the browser when run. An alert is just a statement made in the popup window. A confirm gives the user the option to press "ok" or "cancel" when they read the statement in the popup window. Finally, a prompt requires a user-typed response to the popup window. </li>
                <li>Conditional Statements - Conditions check the status of the code and help the program determine what to do. The "if" keyword allows us to specify code that should be run if the statement is satisfied. "If-else" statements can be used to check for another condition. Finally, "else" statements can be used to run code if none of the other statements are met.</li>
                <li>Arrays - Arrays let us store multiple values within a single variable. In code, we can access one of the values of an array. </li>
                <li>Random Numbers - Random number generators can be used to create random eveents while the code is running. "Math.random" is what is used to generate a random number.</li>
                <li>Loops - "For loops" allow a code operation to be exeecuted repeatedly. A for loop is written by having the amount of times it should run in a set of paranthesis and curly brackets that contain the code that should be run. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
         <!--DOM Model-->
        <div>
            <h3>The DOM (Document Object Model)</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The DOM is a representation of HTML modeled as JavaScript objects. HTML elements have parent-child relationships. Using "document.-" we can alter these relationships, therefore editing the actual HTML page itself. This is much easier to look at for the user rather than using alerts. Jquery makes editing HTML pages even easier.</p>
